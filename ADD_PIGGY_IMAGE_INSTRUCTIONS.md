üìù INSTRUCTIONS: Adding the Piggy Bank Image

1. Save the piggy bank image you attached as: "piggy-bank.png"

2. Place it in this folder: 
   C:\Users\Grace\PiggyPal\assets\images\piggy-bank.png

3. The login screen code is already updated to use this image!

ALTERNATIVE: If you can't save the image file, you can use a web URL temporarily by replacing the source line in LoginScreen-simple.js:

Replace:
  source={require('../../assets/images/piggy-bank.png')}

With:
  source={{ uri: 'YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE' }}

The image will appear at 120x120 pixels, centered above "Welcome to Piggy Pal!" text.
